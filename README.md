# BrainStation Coffee Shop

This project entails creating a basic functional multi-page static website for a local coffee shop, leveraging HTML, CSS/SASS and component thinking.
BEM methodology is used for class names and Flexbox for layout. The layout is responsive and looks good at all dimensions.
